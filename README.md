## Zero-delay Feedback Transistor Ladder Filter

This model solves a set of equations that approximates a Moog Ladder Filter using an OTA structure. The implicit equations are nonlinear, and need to be solved using numerical methods.

### Project Components:
* Python Prototypes
* Reseach Paper
* Max MSP External (Ladder, OTA Cascade, VCA)
* Cross-platform C++ JUCE Plugin (planned)
